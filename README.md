# Ansible demo

My demo repository for learning Ansible

## Idea

This repository is a simple showcase of me using and learning Ansible

Since I've started learning it I had to keep my work somewhere, that's why I've created this repository

> I use this YouTube course as a reference to learn Ansible: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLT98CRl2KxKEUHie1m24-wkyHpEsa4Y70

## Overview

I use virtual machines to learn Ansible:

| VM             | Distribution        | Purpose                                                | User    |
| -------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------- |
| Ansible server | Ubuntu Server 24.04 | Ansible admin host to manage other machines            | Ubuntu  |
| Ansible host 1 | Ubuntu Server 24.04 | Ansible host for working with Ansible                  | Ansible |
| Ansible host 2 | Ubuntu Server 24.04 | Ansible host for working with Ansible                  | Ansible |
| Ansible host 3 | RedOS 8 / RedHat 8  | Ansible host for working with Ansible and other distro | Ansible |
| Ansible host 4 | Ubuntu Server 24.04 | Ansible hosts for testing Ansible funcs                | Ansible |
